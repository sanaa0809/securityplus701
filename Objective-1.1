1.1 General Security Concepts

Objective: Compare and Contrast various types of security controls
Technical Controls:
Focuses on implementing through technology and software.

Examples: Firewalls, encryption, access controls.

Purpose: Safeguarding systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access or alterations.
Effective security involves a combination of technical, managerial, operational, and physical controls for comprehensive protection.

Managerial Controls:
Focuses on policies, procedures, and management decisions.

Examples: Security policies, risk assessments, training programs.

Purpose: Establishing a security framework, defining roles, and ensuring compliance.

Effective security involves a combination of technical, managerial, operational, and physical controls for comprehensive protection.

Operational Controls:
Focuses on involving day-to-day processes and activities.

Examples: Security awareness training, incident response procedures.

Purpose: Managing and monitoring security operations, ensuring effective implementation of policies.

Effective security involves a combination of technical, managerial, operational, and physical controls for comprehensive protection.

Physical Controls:
Focuses on pertaining tangible elements, facilities, and equipment.

Examples: Biometric access, locks, surveillance systems.

Purpose: Protecting physical assets, restricting access to sensitive areas.

Effective security involves a combination of technical, managerial, operational, and physical controls for comprehensive protection.

Technical vs. Managerial:
Technical: Relies on technology; Managerial: Involves policies and decisions.

Managerial vs. Operational:
Managerial: Policy-oriented; Operational: Day-to-day processes and activities.

Operational vs. Physical:
Operational: Daily security activities; Physical: Tangible elements and facilities.

Physical vs. Technical:
Physical: Tangible security measures; Technical: Technology-based controls.

Preventive Controls:
Focuses on aiming to prevent incidents or unauthorized access.

Examples: Firewalls, access controls, encryption.

Purpose: Stop security incidents before they occur.

Effective security often involves a combination of preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, compensating, and directive controls for a comprehensive defense strategy.

Deterrent Controls:
Focuses on discouraging potential attackers through visible security measures.

Examples: Warning signs, security cameras, security patrols.

Purpose: Create a deterrent effect to dissuade unauthorized activities.

Effective security often involves a combination of preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, compensating, and directive controls for a comprehensive defense strategy.

Detective Controls:
Focuses on identifying and responding to security incidents after they occur.

Examples: Intrusion detection systems, log monitoring.

Purpose: Discover and report on security breaches or incidents.

Effective security often involves a combination of preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, compensating, and directive controls for a comprehensive defense strategy.

Corrective Controls:
Focuses on remediating the effects of security incidents.

Examples: Incident response, system restoration.

Purpose: Mitigate damage and restore systems to a secure state.

Effective security often involves a combination of preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, compensating, and directive controls for a comprehensive defense strategy.

Compensating Controls:
Focuses on providing alternative measures when primary controls are ineffective.

Examples: Additional monitoring, enhanced authentication.

Purpose: Compensate for weaknesses in other controls.

Effective security often involves a combination of preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, compensating, and directive controls for a comprehensive defense strategy.

Directive Controls:
Focuses on specify acceptable behaviors and actions.

Examples: Policies, standards, procedures.

Purpose: Guide individuals and organizations in adhering to security requirements.

Effective security often involves a combination of preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, compensating, and directive controls for a comprehensive defense strategy.

Preventive vs. Detective:
Preventive: Stop incidents before; Detective: Identify incidents after.

Deterrent vs. Corrective:
Deterrent: Discourage hacker; Corrective: Remediate after incidents.

Compensating vs. Directive:
Compensating: Provide alternatives; Directive: Specify acceptable actions.
