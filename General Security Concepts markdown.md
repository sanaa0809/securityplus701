1.1 General Security Concepts

Objective: Compare and Contrast various types of security controls

Technical Controls: These are put into practice by using technology to automate security procedures. To control access and safeguard resources and systems, they incorporate hardware or software techniques. </div> 
Examples: Firewalls, encryption, access controls.
Purpose: Safeguarding systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access or alterations. Effective security involves a combination of technical, managerial, operational, and physical controls for comprehensive protection.

Managerial Controls: These include rules, regulations, and guidelines to monitor and regulate the information system; they are also referred to as administrative controls.
Examples: Security policies, risk assessments, training programs.
Purpose: Establishing a security framework, defining roles, and ensuring compliance.

Operational Controls: Operational controls are procedures or policies that reduce security risk. Unlike systems, individuals perform these security controls.
Examples: Security awareness training, incident response procedures.
Purpose: Managing and monitoring security operations, ensuring effective implementation of policies.

Physical Controls: A physical control is one that stops certain physical behaviors, such tailgating, from happening. Physical controls shield a system from certain input from people and are mostly intended to stop anything from operating accidentally.
Examples: Biometric access, locks, surveillance systems.
Purpose: Protecting physical assets, restricting access to sensitive areas.

Technical vs. Managerial:
Technical: Creates, installs, and keeps track of spyware, malware, and updated security measures on devices.
Managerial: Conducts research, creates, and implements new cybersecurity tactics and trends that can best fit a companies tech safety and policies.

Technical: Creates, installs, and keeps track of spyware, malware, and updated security measures on devices.

Preventive Controls: It prevents any security breach from occurring. Aimed at preventing an incident from occurring.
Examples: Firewalls, access controls, encryption, proximity cards or biometrics at the entrance to the building
Purpose: Stop security incidents before they occur.

Deterrent Controls: Attempts to prevent incidents by discouraging threats. Aimed at discouraging individuals from causing an incident.
Examples: Warning signs, security cameras, security patrols, and hardware locks
Purpose: Create a deterrent effect to dissuade unauthorized activities.

Detective Controls: Detective controls attempt to detect any break-in that has already happened. Aimed at detecting incidents after they have occurred.
Examples:Security audits, log monitoring, video surveillance systems, and motion detection systems
Purpose: Discover and report on security breaches or incidents.

Corrective Controls: Corrective controls attempt to reverse the impact of an incident or problem after it has occurred. Aimed at reversing the impact of an incident.
Examples: Incident response, backups and system restoration. When an intruder is detected, active intrusion detection systems (IDSs) activate devices that stop the incursion from progressing.
Purpose: Mitigate damage and restore systems to a secure state.

Compensating Controls: These are alternative controls used when a primary control is not feasible or when it isn't possible to use the primary control to enhance a primary control.
Examples: Additional monitoring, enhanced authentication. Preventive control also includes using a PIN or a proximity card.
Purpose: Compensate for weaknesses in other controls.

Directive Controls: Created guidelines and requirements that an organization has to follow to in order to maintain security.
Examples: Policies, standards, procedures.
Purpose: Guide individuals and organizations in adhering to security requirements.

Preventive vs. Detective:
Preventive: Prevents any security breach from occurring.
Detective: Attempts to detect any break-ins that have already happened.

Deterrent vs. Corrective: 
Deterrent: Attempts to prevent incidents by discouraging threats.
Corrective: Attempts to reverse the impact of an incident or problem after it has occurred.

Compensating vs. Directive: 
Compensating: Used when a primary control is not feasible or when it isn't possible to use the primary control
Directive: Requirements that an organization has to follow to in order to maintain security.
